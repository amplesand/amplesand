## hi. you can call me Amp.
 
 ### fun facts about me
 - I hate Github, but the devs won't leave this shit platform.
 - My favorite hobby is dd'ing public computers into a copy of my Artix USB.
 - I am trying to learn Japanese, C++, and C. 
 - I know Ruby, and I have the common sense for basic scripting across many platforms.
 - I know Python as well, but unless I am somehow forced to use Python, I would sooner drink from a glass of my own vomit.
 - 3DS Homebrew is so underrated. Seriously, pick up one of those little things and mod it.
 - The Mother video game series is beautiful. Play it. I recommend the GBA Mother 1+2 Translation for Mother, Mother 2 Perfect Edition (look on RHDN) for Mother 2/Earthbound, and the Mother 3 Fan Translation by Jeffman and Tomato.
 - I'm a systemd hater.
 - I'm a proprietary hater.
 - I'm an English hater. tenpo li sike mute mute e toki pona a!
 - Decimal isn't the best. I agree with jan Misali on the use of [seximal](https://seximal.net/).
 - I hate capitalism; though, it sucks quite a bit less than other economic systems.
 - The Pinephone is OPEN HARDWARE *AND* OPEN SOFTWARE. The specs to it are on the Pine64 wiki.
